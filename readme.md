🚀🚀🚀 INTERDIMENSIONAL GUIDE 🚀🚀🚀

Navigating through the multiverse of "Rick and Morty" episodes is a breeze with this portal gun of an app.

You've got your whole list of interdimensional escapades lined up on the left, just scroll through them like you're gliding through the cosmos.

Pick an episode, any episode and.. BAM! it pops up right in the central viewfinder of your screen. There you go: all the nitty-gritty, the what, the who, and the where of that particular slice of the Rick and Morty saga.

It's like having your own personal Rick Sanchez giving you the lowdown, minus the burps and existential rants.

Want to know which of the infinite versions of the Smith family shows up or what mind-bending, universe-tangling shenanigans they're up to? Just click, and it's showtime, baby!

ISSUES

Problems fulfilling the main section container after some changes: After a long commit I found a malfunction in the character due to something I changed but I could not find. Therefore, after clicking on a new episode, cards would not actualize but would be added before end. Finally I choose to add a variable in order to clean the container between actions.

Sidebar: I set a green border in the sidebar but It does not fill the whole height as It is suppose to do when you click the episodes button.

Calendar organization: I am getting used to flexibilize my calendar organization in case I get stucked or any external incident takes place. This time I have suffered two Internet breakdowns, the last one being on the delivery day.
