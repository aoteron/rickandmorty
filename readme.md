INTERDIMENSIONAL GUIDE ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

Navigating through the multiverse of "Rick and Morty" episodes is a breeze with this portal gun of an app.

You've got your whole list of interdimensional escapades lined up on the left, just scroll through them like you're gliding through the cosmos.

Pick an episode, any episode and.. BAM! it pops up right in the central viewfinder of your screen. There you go: all the nitty-gritty, the what, the who, and the where of that particular slice of the Rick and Morty saga.

It's like having your own personal Rick Sanchez giving you the lowdown, minus the burps and existential rants.
